An interactive Excel dashboard that uncovers patterns in sales, discounts, profit margins, and product performance from Amazon India's sales data.


## üîç Project Objective

To analyse Amazon India sales data and build a sleek, interractive dashboard using Excel to reveal key insights such as:
- Top-selling products
- Product categories with the highest sales
- Product categories witht the best discount-to-price ratios
- Visual storytelling of performance metrics


## üßÆ Main KPIs

- **Total Revenue**: Overall sales generated from all listed products.
- **Units Sold**: Total quantity of products sold across all categories.
- **Top-Selling Products**: Identified based on volume and revenue contribution.
- **Average Rating**: General product quality as perceived by customers.
- **Average Discount (%)**: Insights into pricing strategy and customer incentives.
- **Best Bargains**: Products offering the most savings relative to original price.
- **Category Performance**: Comparative performance analysis across product categories.
- **Price Sensitivity**: Evaluation of how discounts affect product popularity and reviews.


## üõ†Ô∏è Project Process

1. **Explored and validated the Amazon sales dataset**  
   - Reviewed the raw data for completeness, consistency, and relevance to the objectives.

2. **Imported and cleaned data using Power Query with helper columns**  
   - Applied transformations to fix data types, remove duplicates, and engineer new columns (e.g., profit, discount, savings).

3. **Designed an interactive Excel dashboard to visualize insights**  
   - Created charts and KPIs using Pivot Tables, slicers, and conditional formatting to uncover sales, discounts, and profit patterns.

### üöÄ Skills / Concepts Demonstrated

- **Data Exploration & Validation** ‚Äì Assessed dataset structure, identified missing/inconsistent values.
- **Data Cleaning** ‚Äì Removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized column formats.
- **Data Transformation with Power Query** ‚Äì Created helper columns (e.g., discount %, converted price units) to improve data modeling.
- **Pivot Table Aggregation** ‚Äì Summarized key metrics like revenue, discounts, review counts by product and category.
- **KPI Design & Benchmarking** ‚Äì Defined key performance indicators such as sales volume, average rating, and discount effectiveness.
- **Interactive Dashboard Design in Excel** ‚Äì Used slicers, charts (bar, stacked bar, scatter), and formatted data labels for dynamic insights.
- **Insight Generation** ‚Äì Identified patterns like price sensitivity, review distribution, and discount vs rating dynamics.
- **Data Storytelling & Visualization Best Practices** ‚Äì Prioritized readability (font, layout, labels), added custom background, and consistent visual hierarchy.


## üß† Key Insights
- **Top-selling products** are concentrated in categories like Electronics and Apparel, with mobile phones (**The Redmi 9 Activ**) leading in volume and revenue.
- **High revenue does not always correlate with high ratings** ‚Äî some of the most sold products had moderate or even low average ratings.
- **Best bargains** (high savings + high actual prices) are dominated by electronics, where discounts translate into significant absolute savings.
- **Discount impact analysis revealed** that heavily discounted products do **not necessarily receive higher ratings or more reviews**.
- The **optimal review-to-discount ratio** appears to occur within a **36%‚Äì61% discount range**, suggesting this is the sweet spot where customers perceive value and respond positively.
- An **average rating of 4.1** was observed across all products, while **top-selling products averaged 4.5**, indicating quality plays a role in high performance.


## üìå Conclusion & Recommendations

### ‚úÖ Conclusion
This analysis of Amazon India sales data reveals key patterns in product performance, pricing strategy, and customer feedback. High-performing categories tend to combine strong customer ratings with high sales volumes, while discounting alone does not guarantee customer satisfaction or increased reviews. Products with discounts in the 36‚Äì61% range appear to strike the best balance between customer engagement and perceived value.

### üí° Recommendations
- **Optimize Discounts Within the 36‚Äì61% Range**  
  Products in this range showed a favorable balance between review volume and average rating, suggesting this is a sweet spot for price sensitivity.

- **Leverage Top-Rated, High-Volume Products**  
  Focus marketing and inventory efforts on categories that perform well in both rating and volume to maximize returns.

- **Deprioritize Deep Discounts That Don‚Äôt Convert**  
  Products with very high discounts but poor reviews or low sales volume should be reevaluated for value delivery or quality concerns.

- **Use Data-Driven Bundling or Promotions**  
  Combine best-performing products or categories in promotional bundles to drive cross-sales.

- **Monitor Ratings as Leading Indicators**  
  A 4.1 average rating is typical, but products exceeding 4.5 consistently fall into the top-selling tier‚Äîthis can inform future product curation.
